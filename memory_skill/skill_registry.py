"""Skill Registry — answers "do we already know this skill?"

The active-learning loop's first step: before searching the web for a
topic, the agent checks whether the skill is already in memory.  This
module performs that check by querying the ``skill`` category with the
semantic retriever and applying the same answerability logic the
capability registry uses — but scoped to skill entries only.

Returns a tri-state verdict:
  - ``known``    — a skill entry matches strongly (sem ≥ strong threshold)
  - ``partial``  — related skill entries exist but none is a strong match
  - ``unknown``  — nothing relevant in the skill category

The agent uses the verdict to decide whether to learn (unknown / partial)
or to reuse / update (known / partial) the existing skill memory.
